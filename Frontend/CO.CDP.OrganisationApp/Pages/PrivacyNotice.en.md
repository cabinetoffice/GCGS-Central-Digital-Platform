This notice sets out how the Find a Tender service (FTS) will use your personal data and your rights in relation to that data. It is made under Articles 13 and 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).  

## Your data

### Purpose
   
The Find a Tender service (FTS) is provided by the Cabinet Office. Contracting authorities act as joint data controllers for this service. 

The purpose of FTS is to publish procurement notices and related information as required by the Procurement Act 2023 and Procurement Regulations 2024 and other relevant procurement regimes, for example the Public Contracts Regulations 2015\.  

It is also to facilitate participation in public procurement under the Procurement Act 2023 where contracting authorities require suppliers to register with the service provided by the Cabinet Office and complete their 'supplier information'. This supplier information can then be shared from the Cabinet Office FTS by the supplier to the relevant contracting authority to process and review at the time of bidding.  

We collect and use personal data to facilitate: 

* the registration process onto the digital system, including matching GOV.UK One Login users to existing accounts and transferring existing account information    
* compliance with the Procurement Regulations 2024 and other relevant procurement regimes by a contracting authority in whose procurement a supplier wishes to participate 

The Cabinet Office is an independent data controller for personal data required for using the Statement of Work (SoW) Tool that is only available to contacting authorities on this platform.

### Types of personal data that may be collected

#### Personal data of all users

We will collect personal data on all users to facilitate the necessary registration process onto the digital system. The personal data we will collect is: 

* name   
* email address 

The additional personal data we collect from suppliers and those 'connected people' who the supplier is obliged to provide information on may include: 

* address   
* date of birth   
* nationality   
* country of residence   
* associations with legal entities 

We will collect your email address to facilitate the following activities on the Find a Tender service: 

* tell you about changes to notices you are following   
* alert you about new notices that match your saved search criteria   
* alert you about deadlines for notices you are following   
* keep you updated with changes to the service   
* invite you to participate in user or evaluation research where there is a legitimate interest  
* reduce the number of times this information is required to be inputted manually within the service

Personal data relating to the SoW Tool is limited to the contacting authorityâ€™s email addresses and user login information, which are used for managing access and analysing use of the service. You may be invited to participate in user research.

### Types of sensitive data that may be collected

We will collect criminal convictions data of suppliers and their 'connected people', who the supplier is obliged to provide information on within supplier information to comply with Procurement Act 2023 and Procurement Regulations 2024\. 

#### Lawful basis for the processing

The legal basis for processing this personal data is UK GDPR Article 6(1)(c), namely that processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation placed on us as the data controller. In this case that is the obligation of a Minister of the Crown (the Cabinet Office) to provide an online platform (Find a Tender service) for the publication of information required by the Procurement Act 2023 and for the collection and facilitation of sharing supplier information as required by the Procurement Regulations 2024\.  

The lawful basis for processing personal data in relation to using the SoW Tool is legitimate interest, in this case that is to provide and improve the service.

#### Criminal convictions personal data

We may process personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, or suspicion of the commission of an offence, of the supplier and those 'connected people' who the supplier is obliged to provide information on, to facilitate compliance with the Procurement Act 2023 as required by the contracting authority. This information may then be used to determine whether any exclusion grounds for the purposes of public procurement apply.
