# EXTERNALS

> Note: This should not be confused with SIRSI’s own external components.

Externals are temporary components provisioned solely in the integration account to assist external teams during their migration to new accounts that will eventually be managed by us. Organising these components under this structure enables easy cleanup post-migration. However, it’s essential to maintain a well-structured sub-component hierarchy (where possible) to facilitate future provisioning in the new accounts.
