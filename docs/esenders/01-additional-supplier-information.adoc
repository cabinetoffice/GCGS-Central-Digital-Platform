= Additional Supplier Information Modules Guide for eSenders

== Overview

The Central Digital Platform has introduced new Additional Supplier Information (ASI) modules that suppliers must complete when bidding for certain tenders.
These modules include branched journeys for the first time, so the questions and answers retrieved from each organisation may vary based on their responses.

== New Additional SI Modules

The following modules have been added to the Standard Questions form:

. *Steel* - Steel industry-specific requirements and certifications
. *Modern Slavery* - Modern slavery compliance and policies
. *Health & Safety* - Health and safety management systems
. *Cyber Essentials* - Cybersecurity certifications and practices
. *Data Protection* - Data protection and GDPR compliance
. *Payments* - Payment practices and reporting

== New Welsh Additional SI Modules

The following Welsh modules have been added to the Standard Questions form:

. *Steel* - Steel industry-specific requirements and certifications
. *Health & Safety* - Health and safety management systems
. *Exclusions* - Identifying organisations in relation to prohibited lists
. *Quality Management* - Quality management systems, certifications and processes
. *Environmental* - Environmental management systems, certifications and policies

== Question Types in Additional SI Modules

The new modules use these question types that eSenders will encounter in the shared data:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Type |Description |Data Considerations

|1
|Text
|Standard text responses

|2
|FileUpload
|File references and boolean upload status

|3
|YesOrNo
|Boolean responses

|7
|Date
|Date values in standard format

|10
|MultiLine
|Extended text responses

|12
|Url
|URL text values
|===

== Data Validation Rules Applied

While eSenders won't see the validation configuration, they should be aware that supplier answers have been validated according to these rules:

=== Date Validation

* *Past-only dates*: Reporting start dates, certification dates
* *Future dates*: Policy expiry dates, certification renewals

=== Text Validation

* *Percentage values*: Payment statistics (0-100% format)
* *Numeric values*: Days, counts, measurements
* *URL format*: Website addresses and document links

=== File Upload Validation

* *Document requirements*: Policies, certificates, reports
* *Optional uploads*: May have boolean "No document" responses

=== Multi-line Validation

* *Optional text*: May have boolean "No text" responses

== Data Handling Considerations for eSenders

=== Answer Structure

* eSenders will continue to receive *question and answer data only* via the Data Sharing API
* *Variable question sets*: Due to branched journeys, different suppliers may answer different subsets of questions within the same module based on their responses to conditional questions

=== What eSenders Will NOT See

* Question grouping and multi-page configurations
* UI layout options (input width, suffix text, custom styling)
* Branching logic metadata (nextQuestionId, nextQuestionAlternativeId)
* Platform-specific validation rules and error messages
* Button content and form navigation elements

== Integration Environment Status

* *Current Status*: All Additional SI modules are available in the integration environment
* *Production Deployment*: Planned for *early 2026*
* *Testing*: eSenders should test against integration environment forms

== Localisation Status

* *English Content*: Fully implemented for all modules
* *Welsh Content*: Some Welsh translations are outstanding and will be added in future releases

== API Contract Assurance

====
No changes have been made to the Data Sharing API contract:

* Existing API endpoints remain unchanged
* Response formats are consistent with the current implementation
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms unchanged
* Error handling and status codes remain the same
====

== Module-Specific Answer Patterns

=== Payments Module

* *Financial Data*: Multiple reporting periods with percentage and numeric values
* *Structured Answers*: Related payment statistics grouped logically
* *Optional Evidence*: File upload answers may be boolean (no document provided)

=== Modern Slavery Module

* *Policy Answers*: Mix of text descriptions, dates, and document references
* *Compliance Data*: Yes/No responses for policy existence and implementation
* *Evidence Documents*: Optional file uploads for policies and procedures

=== Steel/Health & Safety/Cyber Essentials/Data Protection

* *Certification Data*: Dates, reference numbers, and document uploads
* *Evidence Requirements*: Document uploads for certificates and policies

=== Welsh Steel Module

* *Policy Answers*: Mix of text, file upload and Yes/No answers
* *Evidence Documents*: Optional uploads for details, policies, standards and procedure
* *Textual Responses*: Descriptions, policies, standards or procedures, some are optional

=== Welsh Health and Safety Module

* *Policy Answers*: Mix of text/multi-line, file upload and Yes/No answers
* *Evidence Documents*: Optional uploads for CVs, certificates and policies
* *Structured Answers*: Safety group membership details grouped logically
* *Optional Answers*: Some answers may not appear based on branching logic from Yes/No responses
* *Textual Responses*: Membership numbers, descriptions, some mult-line text

=== Welsh Exclusions Module

* *Policy Answers*: Mix of multi-line text and Yes/No answer
* *Textual Responses*:  Mult-line text descriptions for exclusion details
* *Optional Answers*: Some answers will not appear based on branching logic from Yes/No response

=== Welsh Environmental Module

* *Policy Answers*: Mix of file uploads and Yes/No answers
* *Evidence Documents*: Optional uploads for certificates and policies
* *Optional Answers*: Some answers may not appear based on branching logic from Yes/No responses

=== Welsh Quality Management Module

* *Policy Answers*: Mix of file uploads and Yes/No answer
* *Evidence Documents*: Optional uploads for certifications and policies
* *Optional Answers*: Some answers may not appear based on branching logic from Yes/No responses

== Recommendations for eSenders

* *Test Integration*: Thoroughly test against integration environment to understand answer structures
* *Share Feedback*: Provide feedback to the CDP technical team on integration experiences and any issues encountered
