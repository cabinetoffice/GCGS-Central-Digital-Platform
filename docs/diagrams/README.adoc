= Diagrams

Architecture diagrams are managed with Structurizr DSL in `workspace.dsl` file.
Edit the file to update diagrams.

Start Structurizr Lite to view and export the diagrams:

[source,bash]
----
make structurizr
----

Open http://localhost:9999/ to view the diagrams and manage the layout.

WARNING: Unfortunately, diagrams cannot be exported automatically from the command line.
Each time a diagram is changed it has to be exported via the UI and copied to the `export/` directory.
