= 2. Create web api clients

Date: 2023-03-25

== Status

Accepted

== Context

We need to create clients for each of our web api services to be used internally (at least initially).
Clients must be compliant with the OpenAPI contracts we expose, so that once we expose them externally
we're sure of their correctness.

Microsoft is planning to make OpenAPI support a first-class citizen in ASP.NET Core.
Swashbuckle is scheduled to be dropped in .NET 9 (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54599).
NSwag is the most feature-rich library in the ecosystem, and their maintainer already raised concerns Microsoft will
make NSwag redundant.

We have considered a number of options to move forward.

=== Option 1: Craft clients from scratch

Create a `Client` interface for each service and implement it with `HttpClient`.
This will require writing a lot of code ourselves based on the OpenAPI contract
and keeping it in sync with the changing contract.

Advantages:

* "It's just code", so it's easy to change.
* It's more flexible compared to generating code.

Disadvantages:

* Needs a process to keep the client in sync with the OpenAPI contract.
* Needs more tests to guarantee client's compliance with the OpenAPI contract.
* Requires effort and time.

=== Option 2: Generate clients based on OpenAPI contracts (Kiota)

https://github.com/microsoft/kiota[Kiota] is a command-line tool for generating API clients
based on OpenAPI descriptions. It's developed by Microsoft and has a nice programming API.

Here's an example code using the generated Kiota client:

[source,csharp]
----
var authProvider = new AnonymousAuthenticationProvider();
var httpClient = new HttpClient
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:5182")
};
var adapter = new HttpClientRequestAdapter(authProvider, httpClient: httpClient);
var client = new TenantClient(adapter);

var tenant = await client.Tenants.PostAsync(new NewTenant
{
    Name = $"Bob {Guid.NewGuid()}",
    ContactInfo = new TenantContactInfo
    {
        Email = "bob@example.com",
        Phone = "07925344234"
    }
});

// Properties are nullable even though they're required in the contract
var tenantId = tenant?.Id ?? Guid.Empty;
var foundTenant = await client.Tenants[tenantId].GetAsync();

Assert.Equivalent(
    new Models.Tenant
    {
        Id = tenantId,
        Name = tenant!.Name,
        ContactInfo = new TenantContactInfo
        {
            Email = "bob@example.com",
            Phone = "07925344234"
        }
    },
    foundTenant
);
----

Advantages:

* Generated clients are compliant with the OpenAPI contract.
* Generated clients can be refreshed when the OpenAPI contract changes.
* Saves development time.
* The tool comes from Microsoft and has an opportunity to become the standard in the .NET ecosystem.

Disadvantages:

* It doesn't seem to support some of the OpenAPI spec yet.
* Nullable properties make it awkward to use. This won't be even considered for fixing until Kiota v3
  (we're at Kiota v1 now).

=== Option 3: Generate clients based on OpenAPI contracts (NSwag)

https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag[NSwag] is the most feature-rich OpenAPI toolchain in the .NET ecosystem.
It support generating clients as well as OpenAPI contracts.

NSwag is actively maintained, but there's a risk of it becoming eventually redundant since Microsoft
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54599[revealed their plans].

Advantages:

* Generated clients are compliant with the OpenAPI contract.
* Generated clients can be refreshed when the OpenAPI contract changes.
* Saves development time.
* It's well maintained.
* It is mature.
* It is feature-rich.

Disadvantages:

* There's a risk Microsoft will eventually make NSwag redundant.

Example code using the generated client:

[source,csharp]
----
var baseUrl = "http://localhost:5182";

ITenantClient client = new TenantClient(baseUrl, new HttpClient());

var tenant = await client.CreateTenantAsync(new NewTenant(
    name: $"Bob {Guid.NewGuid()}",
    contactInfo: new TenantContactInfo(
        email: "bob@example.com",
        phone: "07923234234"
    )
));

var foundTenant = await client.GetTenantAsync(tenant.Id);

Assert.Equal(
    new Tenant
    (
        id: tenant.Id,
        name: tenant.Name,
        contactInfo: new TenantContactInfo(
            email: "bob@example.com",
            phone: "07923234234"
        )
    ),
    foundTenant
);
----

== Decision

We will use the NSwag to generate API clients (option 3). The tool is feature-complete and should cause us the least
headaches while saving development time in the same time.

On the server side we should leverage OpenAPI.NET as much as possible (avoid Swashbuckle or NSwag specific types).

== Consequences

We will ensure that OpenAPI contracts are generated at build-time so that client libraries have access to them.
Client libraries will generate the client based on the OpenAPI contract.
