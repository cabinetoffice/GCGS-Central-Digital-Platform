= 5. Database naming conventions

Date: 2024-06-21

== Status

Accepted

== Context

PostgreSQL clients are forced to quote table and column names in SQL queries,
if they're not lower-cased:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT "Name" FROM "Organisations";
----

That's because they're lowercased by default unless quoted.

This is inconvenient when writing queries by hand.

== Decision

We will follow a lowercase naming strategy with `_` separated words.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name FROM organisations;
----

== Consequences

We will switch to the snake case naming convention and migrate existing schema to follow it as well.
