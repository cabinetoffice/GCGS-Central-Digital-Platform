= 6. Shared user sessions

Date: 2024-11-13

== Status

Draft

== Context

We need shared sessions between containers. In dev we only have one instance of the organisation-app that handles user
session. In production we'll be scaling app the organisation-app depending on current demand, so it will never be a
single instance.

We need sessions to be stored outside of the running container (current behaviour), to provide users with a seamless
experience.

There are no Non Functional Requirements provided by the stakeholders, so it's difficult to estimate the number of
concurrent users we have to to prepare for. We've ballpark estimated it to be anything between 50k to 500k, likely
double that at the initial rollout. Customer expects 3.5m active users within first 2 years.

=== Option 1: Sticky sessions

Sticky sessions can be enabled at the infrastructure level, so user's requests are handled by a single container.

Advantages:

* Easy to set up
* No code changes required
* No additional cost

Disadvantages:

* User journeys can be disrupted by sub-optimal distribution across containers, especially during container restarts, i.e. deployments.

=== Option 2: DynamoDB

Advantages:

* Easy to implement
* Cheaper than Redis

Disadvantages:

* Slow compared to other solutions and may not be efficient enough at peak times
* Manual task required to clear expired sessions

=== Option: Redis

Advantages:

* Serverless - easy to scale up or down depending on demand
* Easy to implement
* Low latency - can provide session details with a minimal lag
* Can set up TTL, so expired sessions will be automatically removed

Disadvantages:

* Potentially more expensive than DynamoDB

== Decision

Redis

* It has lower latency compared to DynamoDB
* Future proof given the fact we don't have any metrics provided by the client

== Consequences

We'll use Redis as a service on AWS, docker container on local developer set up. This will require additional DevOps
work as well as modifications to the OrganisationApp to handle shared sessions.

Given the fact we don't have metrics to design the system for, we should plan for the worst case scenario. Once service
is live we can monitor the number of concurrent users and re-evaluate the solution.
