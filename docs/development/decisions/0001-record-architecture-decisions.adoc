= 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-03-04

== Status

Accepted

== Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project
so that future developers understand the context of our solutions.

== Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records,
as http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[described by Michael Nygard].

== Consequences

All significant decisions will be discussed within the team and documented in the decision log including:

* the date decision was made
* the status of the decision (Accepted, Draft, or Rejected)
* the context of the decision
* options that were considered
* the decision made
* the consequences of the decision
