= Development environment

== Requirements

The minimum set of tools required to work on the project covers:

* An IDE of your choice (i.e. Visual Studio, Rider)
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

On Windows, it might be handy to set up https://git-scm.com/downloads[git-bash] or WSL
in order to run tools like Make.

== Setting up

Import the project to your favourite IDE to build and run tests from there.

Alternatively, use the `dotnet` command or the following make targets to build and run tests:

[source,bash]
----
make build
make test
